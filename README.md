> <sup>1</sup> For the Polycarbonate, I personally got the edges chamfered and the corners cut for about $56. This makes the panel identical to an ITG/DDR panel in shape. You can alternatively simply get 10 3⁄4" x 3 15⁄16" rectangles for about $6 per panel.

> <sup>2</sup> I personally had access to a 3D printer so I only spent about $20 in materials. I don't know how much it costs to print these parts using a local service.

> <sup>3</sup> While I don't think laser cutting the wood was needed and one could cut it on their own, I opted to pay for the service for the precision.
